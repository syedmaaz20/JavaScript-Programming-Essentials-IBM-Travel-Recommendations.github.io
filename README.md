# Travel Recommendations Website

## Description

This project is a travel recommendation website developed as part of the JavaScript Programming Essentials course by IBM. The website helps users discover ideal travel destinations based on their preferences, providing personalized suggestions, detailed descriptions, and multimedia content for beaches, temples, and countries.

Key features include:
- **Home Page**: Introduction to the website and featured recommendations with images and interactive descriptions.
- **About Us Page**: Information about the team, mission, vision, and expertise.
- **Contact Us Page**: A functional email form for user inquiries.
- Interactive navigation bar for seamless browsing.
- Recommendations sections:
  - Beach recommendation (e.g., Maldives) with two images.
  - Temple recommendation (e.g., Angkor Wat) with two images.
  - Country-based recommendation (e.g., Japan) with two images.

The site emphasizes a user-centric design with engaging content, background imagery, hover effects, and JavaScript interactivity for toggling detailed descriptions.
